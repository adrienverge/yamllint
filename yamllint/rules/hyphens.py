Use this rule to control the number of spaces after hyphens (``-``).

.. rubric:: Options

* ``max-spaces-after`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed after
  hyphens. Set to a negative integer if you want to allow any number of
  spaces.
* ``min-spaces-after`` defines the minimal number of spaces expected after
  hyphens. Set to a negative integer if you want to allow any number of
  spaces. When set to a positive value, cannot be greater than
  ``max-spaces-after``.
* YAMLLint will consider ``-xx`` as a scalar. However you may consider
  that, in your context, such a syntax is a typo and is actually a sequence
  and as a consequence there should be a space after the hyphen. As this is
  not a standard behaviour, you explicitly need to enable this control by
  setting the option ``check-scalars`` to ``true``.  **Use with caution**
  as all scalars will be checked and non-solvable false positive might be
  identified. Has no effect when set to ``true`` but ``min-spaces-after``
  is disabled (< 0).
