Use this rule to force the type of new line characters.

* Set ``type`` to ``unix`` to enforce UNIX-typed new line characters (``\\n``),
  set ``type`` to ``dos`` to enforce DOS-typed new line characters
  (``\\r\\n``), or set ``type`` to ``platform`` to infer the type from the
  system running yamllint (``\\n`` on POSIX / UNIX / Linux / Mac OS systems or
  ``\\r\\n`` on DOS / Windows systems).
